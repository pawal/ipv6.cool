"## Spoofing prevention\n"
"Spoofing of email is a common attack vector where an attacker sends an email from someone else's mail address. This technique is for example often used to phish for passwords or other valuable information. This can be prevented with authenticity marks based on the standards DMARC, DKIM and SPF. It is important to set a sufficiently strict policy when using these, i.e. `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` for DMARC and `~all` or `-all` for SPF. This was already tested by Internet.nl but as of today these will weigh in the score, as was already announced in the beginning of this year.\n"
"\n"
"## Secure mail server connections\n"
"E-mail in transit that is not encrypted, can be eavesdropped by attackers. The STARTTLS standard prevents passive attackers from reading emails in transit. In addition DANE protects against active attackers stripping STARTTLS encryption by manipulating the mail traffic. Internet.nl already checked for these standards. In this new version of Internet.nl this test is conformant with the [factsheet \"Secure the connections of mail servers\"](https://www.ncsc.nl/english/current-topics/factsheets/factsheet-secure-the-connections-of-mail-servers.html) from the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Furthermore the test results now weigh in the score.\n"

"## About Internet.nl\n"
"Internet.nl helps you to check whether your internet is up to date, i.e. if your website, email and internet connection use modern and reliable Internet Standards. The website Internet.nl is an initiative of the Dutch Internet Standards Platform. The platform is a collaboration between partners from the internet community and the Dutch government.

"The basis for this collaboration is a number of open standards and practices\n"
"that all the network operators have adopted voluntarily. In fact, voluntary\n"
"adoptions is one of the core principles of the\n"
"[Open-Stand paradigm](https://open-stand.org/infographic-the-5-core-principles-of-openstand/).\n"
"\n"
"## Joining the ecosystem\n"
"\n"
"When you connect to the Internet, you become a part of its ecosystem. Even\n"
"more, across the Internet there is no clear line between consumers and\n"
"suppliers; every participant is a contributor. That comes with a collaborative\n"
"responsibility: you should consider not only how the global system impacts\n"
"you, but also the impact you produce on the system through your activity or\n"
"inactivity.\n"
"\n"
"This perspective is especially important in the area of security (also see the\n"
"[Internet Society&#39;s recent paper on Collaborative Security](https://www.internetsociety.org/collaborativesecurity)).\n"
"As an end-user, that means that you do all you can to keep your own systems\n"
"secure, to reduce the risk of their be taken over and used to abuse others.\n"
"For service providers, that means making specific security features available.\n"
"Those offerings and measures may not bring an immediate return on the\n"
"investment, and in the short term they may even lead to additional cost. But\n"
"they will help to raise the level of security in the system and reinforce\n"
"confidence in the Internet.\n"
"\n"
"And therein lays the problem: there is no direct economic incentive for\n"
"individual providers to deploy some of these technologies.\n"
"\n"
"Can&#39;t their deployment be mandated then? In theory yes, but that approach\n"
"would go against one the fundamental and foundational principles of the\n"
"Internet: as an organic system, a network of autonomous networks, not built\n"
"from a global blueprint but developing in accordance with local needs and\n"
"conditions, deployment depends on voluntary agreement and collaboration.\n"
"Forcing security and scalability through global mandates may be slow, and may\n"
"have unintended side effects. It also assumes that a global consensus can be\n"
"reached on a multitude of security issues.\n"
"\n"
"The voluntary collaborative approach, combined with a continuing dialogue with\n"
"those who impact and are impacted by certain measures &mdash; the end-users,\n"
"the policy makers, and the technicians &mdash; allows more flexibility and\n"
"agility. Measures taken can more easily be adjusted to minimise unintended\n"
"adverse consequences.\n"
"\n"
"## &quot;The Internet way&quot;\n"
"\n"
"Accomplishing global deployment of secure, resilient, future-proof internet\n"
"technology is better done &quot;the Internet way&quot;: at the initiative of\n"
"individual actors, based on their own decisions and their own leadership; and\n"
"through sharing know-how and experience, both voluntary and professionally.\n"
"\n"
"One important aspect in getting new innovations deployed is awareness and\n"
"visibility. Deploying these internet technologies is like installing new\n"
"plumbing: something has improved, but the water still tastes the same. Leaders\n"
"who want to inspire their colleagues to follow suit will have to provide some\n"
"visibility into what their innovations brings.\n"
"\n"
"A profound example is the Internet.nl initiative (to be launched soon), in\n"
"which the Dutch Internet community, a ministry, and a governmental agency have\n"
"collaborated to set up a website that helps to highlight the status of\n"
"deployment of key internet technology. The website gives users simple and\n"
"straightforward information about their own access to various innovative\n"
"technologies.\n"
"\n"
"Some of these technologies contribute to the continued scalability of the\n"
"Internet (IPv6 support and transparency of the network), while some relate to\n"
"security (DNSSEC, anti-spam and anti-phishing, and support for encryption). By\n"
"doing so, the site helps to promote the open standards that will make the\n"
"Internet more scalable and more secure. It highlights the leaders, and\n"
"provides the followers with tools and know-how."

In the second half of 2017, i.e. after the redesign, about 650 thousand tests were executed. Gerben Klein Baltink, chair of the Dutch Internet Standards Platform: \n"
"> \"The increase is very nice but modern internet is far from ready yet. We are happy to see a growing number of domains with a 100% score entering our Hall of Fame.

"## Policy checking for DMARC and SPF\n"
"This new version of Internet.nl checks if the syntax of your DMARC and SPF record is correct. Besides the test tool checks if these records contain a sufficiently strict policy in order to prevent abuse of your domain by phishers and spammers.\n"
"\n"
"## Checking validity period for HSTS\n"
"Internet.nl now also checks for the validity period of the HSTS policy. We consider a HSTS cache validity period of at least six months to be sufficiently secure. A long period is beneficial because it also protects infrequent visitors. However if you want to stop supporting HTTPS, you will have to wait longer until the validity of the HSTS policy in all browsers that vistited your website, has expired.\n"
"\n"
"## Impact on test score\n"
"The DMARC/SPF policy and the HSTS validity period do not yet impact the overall percentage score. In case of a deviation an orange warning will be displayed in the test results. As of **April 2018** the results of the test items will be part of the score.\n"

"## Generic\n"
"* The ability to choose a different language from a dropdown menu. Visitors will get the equivalent page in the selected language (if available).\n"
"* The requirement that all name servers must be available over IPv6 has been cancelled. It is sufficient if at least as many name servers are available over IPv6 as there are over IPv4. This applies to both the webite test and the mail test.\n"
"\n"
"## Connection test\n"
"* The detection of the internet provider is more precise and timeouts occur less frequent.\n"
"\n"
"## Website test\n"
"* The test checks whether a HSTS-policy is available. Through HSTS a web browser will 'know' after the first visit that a website can only be accessed through a secure connection (HTTPS, not HTTP). This can prevent so-called man-in-the-middle attacks, e.g. when using public Wi-Fi. In case of deviations, the message is no longer 'orange' but 'red'.\n"
"* The test now checks whether the website enforces HTTPS by using a server redirect (301 or 302) or by applying only HTTPS (and no HTTP). In case of deviations, the message is no longer 'orange' but 'red'.\n"
"* In the case of some websites, the TLS results incorrectly showed that 'client-initiated renegotiation' was allowed. This has been solved.\n"
"* In the test results of websites with a redirect from IPv6/IPv4 to IPv4-only, the HSTS-policy over IPv6 remained incorrectly undetected. This has been solved.\n"
"* The test now checks whether actual HTTP traffic is sent over port 443. If that is not the case, the test will no longer draw incorrect conclusions which are HTTPS-related .\n"
"\n"
"## Mail test\n"
"* If Internet.nl cannot establish a connection to a mail server (e.g. by 'rate limiting'), visitors will now be asked to try again later.\n"
"* Thanks to the improved adjustment of timeouts, failure of the test part 'STARTTLS' is less likely. Therefore certain mail servers can now be tested without problems.\n"
"* Running connections serially and minimizing the number of connections should help to reduce the risk of 'rate limiting' of mail servers. Therefore certain mail servers can now be tested which was not possible before.\n"

The latest 'IT guidelines for TLS' from NCSC-NL are used as a baseline. If a 'good' or 'sufficient' setting is found, then Internet.nl will show a green check ('passed'). In case of a 'phase out' setting, like TLS 1.0 and 1.1, you will see an orange exclamation mark ('warning'), and an 'insufficient' configuration gets a red cross ('fail').\n"

"## ICT guidelines for TLS\n"
"In April 2019 NCSC-NL published the ['IT Security Guidelines for Transport Layer Security (TLS) v2.0'](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-tls). The advised settings are future proof; as expected TLS connections which are secured according to the new guidelines will not require any modifications in the near future. At the same time the guidelines also ensure that systems remain interoperable and prevent TLS settings to be incompatible.\n"
"\n"
"## 'Phase out' TLS settings\n"
"'Phase out' settings are known to be fragile and are at risk of becoming insufficiently secure. Take the following into consideration when making a decision regarding these 'phase out' settings.\n"
"\n"
"Browser makers have announced that they will stop supporting TLS 1.1 and 1.0 by Q1 2020. This will impact the reachability of websites that do not offer support for TLS 1.2 and/or 1.3.\n"
"\n"
"Quite some mail servers only support older TLS versions. If the sending and receiving mail server both do not support the same TLS version, they will usually fall back to unencrypted mail transport. Because of that it could be advisable to keep supporting TLS versions with a 'phase out' status for a while. Make an informed decision based on log data on when to disable these 'phase out' TLS versions.\n"

Therefore in the new release the HTTPS configuration is tested over both IPv6 and IPv4. **From now on** the result of this test item is part of the overall score in the website test.\n"
"* The website tests checks whether a **HSTS policy** is published. Through HSTS a web browser gets informed after the first usage that a website only may be visited over HTTPS. This can prevent so-called man-in-the-middle attacks (for example when a public Wi-Fi hotspot is used). The result of this test item is displayed as an orange warning in case the HSTS policy is absent. As of **July 2016** the result will be part of the score in the website test.\n"
"* The website test does test whether **HTTPS is enforced** for a website. There are two ways to enforce HTTPS that are described below.The result of this test item is displayed as an orange warning in case the HSTS policy is absent. As of **July 2016** the result will be part of the score in the website test.\n"
"   1. By redirecting HTTP to HTTPS. This can be done by redirecting `http://example.nl` to `https://example.nl`. It is important that both domain names are identical because a web browser does only accept a HSTS policy for a certain domain when a HTTPS connection is used. If `http://example.nl` redirects to `https://www.example.nl` then a HSTS policy normally will not be used by the browser, unless a user explicitly enters `https://example.nl` or clicks on a hyperlink with this URL.\n"
"   2. By only supporting HTTPS and no HTTP. Because a browser normally uses a HTTP-connection after a user enters a domain name, users should enter `https://example.nl` to reach the website or click on a hyperlink with this URL.\n"
"* The website test does check whether **HTTP compression** is used. Enabling HTTP compression does make many websites vulnerable for BREACH when no other mitigating measures are in place. Switching off HTTP compression could negatively impact performance. In case HTTP compression is detected an **orange warning** is displayed.\n"
"* The website test of the previous version of Internet.nl already checked whether the **content of a website was similar over IPv6 and IPv4**. The test took into account legitimate differences for example caused by different add banners. The result of this test item **from now on** is part of the overall score in the website test. \n"
"* If a user does enter a **non-existing domain name** a red error message is displayed.\n"

"## Test for application security options\n"
"The website test has a new test category for [application security options](/faqs/appsecpriv/). These settings can be sent to the browser via HTTP headers and are often referred to as 'security headers'. The new category contains tests for X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy and Referrer-Policy. For the latter two we check for their existence but do not evaluate the effectivenes of the configured policy. Currently the results of the new tests do not impact the overall score.\n"
